# Preliminaries

#### 1. R Studio Interface

* Console

* Environment

* File Window

* Viewer Window

* History

* Plots

* Help

* Packages

#### 2. Creating Scripts
Create a script to keep track of your analysis. Save the script where you want it.

#### 3. Working Directory
Set the working directory. This tells R where to look for files. Click Session - Set Working Directory - To source file location. Any data files that you want to analyze should be placed here. Also any data files that you save will be saed here.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
getwd()
#setwd("C:/Users/nickvarberg/Desktop/Work/R Shortcourses 2019")
```

#### 4. Packages 
Packages that we will need for today.

* **tidyverse**: "The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures." - Taken directly from their website

* **fivethirtyeight**: A collection of interesting datasets to analyze.

All of you should have come ready with the tidyverse installed. Many of you will likely not have the the fivethirtyeight package downloaded. How can we install this package to our computer?

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 1:</span>
Install the fivethirtyeight package.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

#### 5. Import Dataset
Now it's time to load the dataset. Note that we will be using a built-in dataset from the fivethirtyeight package that contains information on US Births from 1994 to 2003. If you are importing your own dataset, we address this later in the workshop. Please see the script "r_zero.r" on our OSF site for more information on this. (or just google it). Here is how we load the data from the fivethirtyeight package.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
data <- US_births_1994_2003
```

# Base Functions
Here we list some functions that come in the base pacage of R. We can use these functions to get some basic information on our dataset. 

#### 1. Dimensions
Compute the dimensions of the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
dim(data)
```

#### 2. Number of Rows
Compute the number of rows of the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
nrow(data)
```

#### 3. Number of Columns
Compute the number of columns of the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
ncol(data)
```

#### 4. Column names
Display the column names of the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
colnames(data)
```

#### 5. Head of the data
Display the first few rows of the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
head(data)
```

## <span style="color:red">Tidy Data</span>
Our goal is to have our data "Tidy". Tidy data has two key features. (1) Each row represents a case (ie. observational unit of the sample). (2) Each column represents a variable (ie. an attribute of the cases). Here cases are individual days and variables include month, year, and births. We can always tidy up our data if it comes to us in a non-tidy format using data wrangling techniques which will be addressed in a bit.

#### 6. Structure of the data
Display the data structures for each column.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
str(data)
```

## <span style="color:red">Data Structures</span>
A list of common data types.

* int - integer

* numeric - number

* factor - group

* logical - True/False

* Date - date

<span style="color:red">Note:</span> Sometimes when your data is loaded, R will recognize a column with an incorrect structure. For example, column b is a string but we want it to be numeric. We change it using as.numeric().

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
b <- c("2.0", "3.5", "56.0") 
str(b)
b <- as.numeric(b)
str(b)
```

#### 7. Column Access
Access a column by its name.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
births <- data$births
births
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 2:</span>
Extract the day of the week column into a vector. Try to convert the column into a numeric vector and see what happens.

#### 8. Unique elements of a column
Get the unique elements of a column in a data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Get the unique years of the data
years <- unique(data$year)
years
```

#### 9. Maximum of a column
Find the maximum element of a vector.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
maxbirths <- max(births)
maxbirths
```

#### 10. Index of maximum
Find the index where a maximum occurrs.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Find the date of the maximum births
maxindex <- which.max(births)
maxdate <- data$date[maxindex]
maxdate
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 3:</span>
Find the day where the least number of births occurred for our dataset and also find the least number of births.

#### 11. Mean
Compute the mean of a vector.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the average number of births in a given day
mean(births)
```

#### 11. Standard Deviation
Compute the standard deviation of a vector.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the standard deviation of the number of births in a given day
sd(births)
```

# Data Wrangling
There are many useful functions for altering your data frame. 

#### 1. View Dataset
View the data frame in a new window.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Display data frame
View(data)
```

#### 2. Order Data Frame
Order the data frame by a certain column (default is descending order).

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Order by number of births
data <- data %>% arrange(desc(births))
head(data)
```

```{r}
data <- data %>% arrange(year)
head(data)
```

#### 3. Rename Columns
Rename specific columns of your data. 

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Rename dat_of_month and day_of_week columns
data <- data %>% rename(day = date_of_month, weekday = day_of_week)
```

#### 4. Filter Rows
Select rows of a data frame based on a certain condition.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only in the month of July and do the same for Jan
july_data <- data %>% filter(month == 7)
jan_data <- data %>% filter(month == 1)
# Select days only in the month of january
jan_2000_data <- data %>% filter(month == 1 & year == 2000)
dim(jan_2000_data)
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 4:</span>
Filter out the data for the first half of the year (January through June).

#### 5. Select Columns
Select specific columns of a data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only the columns of date and births
selected_data <- data %>% select(date, births)
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 5:</span>
Select the columns for year, day, and births out of july_data.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only in the month of July
july_data <- july_data %>% select(year,day,births)
```

#### 6. Separate Columns
Separate one column into several.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Separate date of selected_data into 3 columns
parsed_data <- selected_data %>% separate(date, c('y','m','d'))
```

#### 7. Creating Columns
Add an additional column to the data frame.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Create a column that indicates if it is a summer month (June, July, August).
data <- data %>% mutate(summer = between(month,6,8))
str(data)
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 6:</span>
Create a column keeping track of the cumulative total of births. Hint: use the summary function "cumsum(colname)".

#### 8. Summarizing
Compute summary statistics of your data frame. 

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the mean number of births for a given day
overall_mean <- data %>% summarise(average = mean(births))
```

#### 9. Grouping by variables
Separate one column into several.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Compute the mean and median number of births by weekday
weekday_mean <- data %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(births))
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 7:</span>
Compute the average number of births by year, along with the standard deviation.

#### 10. Binding Rows
Bind two dataframes together by row.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Bind data frames by row
janjul_data <- jan_data %>%
  bind_rows(july_data)
```

#### 11. Joining Data frames
Bind two dataframes together by similar columns.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Join two data frames together
joined_data <- jan_data %>%
  left_join(july_data, by = c("year","day"))
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 8:</span>
Rename the new columns of joined_data.

#### 12. Gather columns into rows
Separate multiple columns into one.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Select days only in the month of July
gathered_data <- joined_data %>%
  gather(key = month, value = births, c("births.x","births.y"))
# key: column name representing new variable
# value: column name representing variable values
# remaining: columns to gather
```

#### 13. Saving Data Frames
Save the data frame to a .csv file.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
write.csv(gathered_data, "mydataframe.csv")
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 9:</span>
Save one of your data frames in your environment to a csv.

#### 14. Loading Data Frames
Read a .csv file into R.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
loaded_data <- read.csv("mydataframe.csv")
```

# Basic Data Visualization

#### 1. Create a histogram for births

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Histogram of births
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=births)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

#### 2. Plot the number of births as a function of time.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Scatter plot of births
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=c(1:nrow(data)), y = births)) + 
  geom_point()
```

#### 3. Create a boxplot of births by month
```{r echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F}
# Boxplot of births by month
ggplot(data = data, aes(x=as.factor(month), y = births)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## <span style="color:purple">Exercise 10:</span>
Create more plots to figure out what is accounting for our birth differences in our scatter plot. 

# <span style="color:purple">Test Your Skills</span>

* Find the month/year combo with the highest total number of births.

* Find the month/year combo with the least total number of births. 

* Create new columns for the remaining seasons.

* Compute a histogram for the daily births on weekends. 

* Compute the average number of births by season. 

* Extract the births for valentines day. Create a dot-plot of the values. You may have to google how to do this one.

# How to research for R
**Google is your best friend**. There are a ton of resources and online tutorials out there to help you learn R.
